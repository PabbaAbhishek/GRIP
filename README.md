Being a GRIP Business Analytics and Data science intern, I was assighned with tasks relating to machine learning and data analysis.
The tasks are mentioned below:

**Task 1:** Predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours. This task was completed by deploying linear regression machine learning model and with the model, a prediction about student's score who is studying for 9.25 hours/day is made.

**Task 2:** Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ as a business manager and find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. The task was done using **googlesheets/excel** and **tableau**. The results are presented in a ppt.
